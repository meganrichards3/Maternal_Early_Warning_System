# Maternal_Early_Warning_System
This project is supervised by the Duke Institute for Healthcare Innovation and Duke University Hospital System. The project builds a maternal-specific early warning system, which predict the following eight outcomes of Severe Maternal Morbidity (SMM) using time-series data of perinatal encounters: Hemorrhage, Sepsis, Eclampsia, Embolism, Acute Renal Failure, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Acute Heart Failure. 

This respository includes code used to build:

1. Time-specific indicators for the 8 phenotypes 
2. Input datasets from patient flowsheets, problem list data, snomed codes, prenatal visit information, and demographic information. 
3. Modeling experiments for gradient-boosted trees and recurrant neural networks
4. Automated documentation and evaluation code, including analysis of population subgroup performance
